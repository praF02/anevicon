//! This crate can be used as a bot to build a [botnet] for simulating
//! [UDP-based DDoS attacks] (but only for educational and pentesting purposes,
//! see [the GPLv3 license], under which the library is distributed).
//!
//! This library was designed to be as convenient and reliable as it is
//! possible, but for only Linux-based systems. If you are just interested in
//! one single program, please take a look at [this one].
//!
//! # Examples
//! This example demonstrates sending a couple of messages to the `example.com`
//! domain (just for an example, you should enter here your server):
//!
//! ([`examples/minimal.rs`])
//! ```rust,no_run
//! #![feature(iovec)]
//!
//! use std::io::IoVec;
//! use std::net::UdpSocket;
//!
//! use anevicon_core::{TestSummary, Tester};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!    // Setup the socket connected to the example.com domain
//!    let socket = UdpSocket::bind("0.0.0.0:0").unwrap();
//!    socket.connect("93.184.216.34:80").unwrap();
//!
//!    // Setup all the I/O vectors (messages) we want to send
//!    let payload = &mut [
//!        (0, IoVec::new(b"Generals gathered in their masses")),
//!        (0, IoVec::new(b"Just like witches at black masses")),
//!        (0, IoVec::new(b"Evil minds that plot destruction")),
//!        (0, IoVec::new(b"Sorcerers of death's construction")),
//!    ];
//!
//!    // Send all the created messages using only one system call
//!    let mut summary = TestSummary::default();
//!    let mut tester = Tester::new(&socket, &mut summary);
//!
//!    println!(
//!        "The total packets sent: {}, the total seconds passed: {}",
//!        tester.send_multiple(payload).unwrap().packets_sent(),
//!        summary.time_passed().as_secs()
//!    );
//! }
